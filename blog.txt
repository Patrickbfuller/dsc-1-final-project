Key questions:
    -What aspects best predict the cost of a house in King County? What do you really need to know about a house to accurately predict its price?
    -What information is unhelpful?
    -How do we measure success? We use MAE primarily.
    -Given that information, what's our predicted price for a given house?
    
 Step 1: Data Understanding
     What's going on with with the data initially?
      Our target is "price," but its histogram shows a slightly skewed distribution with a high kurtosis. Using natural "log_price," shows a more normal distribution, an essential assumption for linear regression.
      
      
      
      What columns could be disregarded?
      "id" and "date" did not correlate with price and are functionally more similar to names than numbers. "bedrooms" had no linear relationship with price and contained a huge outlier of 33 bedrooms, and . Moreover the minimum number of bedrooms in the dataset is one but the "sqft_living" of some of those houses implies studios, throughing doubt into the validity of that category. "sqft_lotsquare" was often much, much higher than "sqft_living" for the same dwelling; implying this may be the lot size for an entire building.
