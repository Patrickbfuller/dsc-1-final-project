    PREDICTORS(initial review from raw multivar regresn)
bedrooms:  
            -Rubbish
            -indicating value = 1 for presumable studios
            , neg corr on raw multivar regression???
            thinking  THROW OUT
Bathrooms:
            -A team
sqft_liv: 
            -A team
            -little skewed,  good corr -> prob log norm  

sqft_lot:  -Rubbish
            -indicating size of apt buildings
            ,     - THROW OUT - 

floors:
            -Rubbish
            -wild p val when raw

wtrft: 
            - A team
            -hi coef, lo p
            -not very correlated with other predictors 
            
view:
            
            -hi coef, lo p
            , "wouldn't nicer places just be viewed more??
                How could it cause a higher price??
                Could deter lo-balling"
                
condxn:
            - Rubbish
            -grade seems to be a better indicator
            , and they're refering to the same thing rigght?

grade:
            - A team. v.corr()
            -seems to be better indicator than condxn
            
sqft_above:
            - Put on the B team
            -not as strong as sqft_liv and they're covering 
                the same thing
            , maybe use a ratio of 'what portion of sqft is
                above the basement??'
                
sqft_base:
            B -team
            -similar thoughts
            , also some 'question mark' values
            one-hot for has basement? or not
            
yr_built:
            -neg coef in model??
            , maybe combine with yr_reno'd
            
yr_reno'd:
            -turn into time since repair
            
zip:
            -bool for 'in seattle'?
            
lat&long:
            -compute distance from seattle center
            
living15:
           -A team
           -v corr()
